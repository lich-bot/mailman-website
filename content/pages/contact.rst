About Us
~~~~~~~~

First, who is "Us"?

GNU Mailman is `free software
<https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html>`__, developed and used by people
from all over the world.  We work on Mailman as volunteers and give it away
for free.  There is no official paid support organization behind Mailman; we
are a community.

That said, there are some official channels for contacting the folks involved
with Mailman.


The GNU Mailman Steering Committee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have a steering committee of long-time core developers who collectively
make most of the global project-based decisions.  If you'd like to contact us

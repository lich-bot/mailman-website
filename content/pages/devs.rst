Developer Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're the kind of person who loves to get elbow deep in code, there
are lots of opportunities to dig into Mailman. The next version of
Mailman is under active development and we would welcome your input and
contributions.

The primary gathering point for all development should be the `Mailman
Wiki <http://wiki.list.org>`__ and specifically the `Development home
space <http://wiki.list.org/display/DEV/Home>`__ on the wiki. Because
wikis are intended to be collaborative, you're free to contribute to
this page in true wiki fashion.

You may want to find a project on our Mailman `TODO
list <https://wiki.list.org/DEV/Mailman%203.0#todo>`__. You will also
definitely want to subscribe to the
`mailman-developers <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-developers>`__
mailing list.

Launchpad Project Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Developers should start with the `Mailman project at
Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/mailman>`__. All patches, bugs, and
branches should be submitted here so they won't get lost, although it is
also requested that you inform the mailman-developers list about your
submissions. Please do not send patches to the mailing list!

You might also want to look at the `old Mailman project page at
SourceForge <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mailman>`__. We appreciate
the years of good service from the SourceForge guys, but we've moved all
Mailman development to `Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/mailman>`__. Be
aware that while the SF trackers are still live so as to support
historical incoming links, any changes you make to them will **not** be
noticed by the Mailman developers.

IRC
~~~

Some of the Mailman developers also occasionally hang out on the
*#mailman* IRC channel at freenode.net. Stop by!

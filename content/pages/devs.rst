Developer Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're the kind of person who loves to get elbow deep in code, there are
lots of opportunities to dig into Mailman.  Mailman 3 is under active
development and we would welcome your input and contributions.

The primary gathering point for all development should be the `Mailman
Wiki <http://wiki.list.org>`__ and specifically the `Development home
space <http://wiki.list.org/display/DEV/Home>`__ on the wiki. Because
wikis are intended to be collaborative, you're free to contribute to
this page in true wiki fashion.

You may want to find a project on our Mailman `TODO
list <https://wiki.list.org/DEV/Mailman%203.0#todo>`__. You will also
definitely want to subscribe to the
`mailman-developers <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-developers>`__
mailing list.

**Please do not send patches to the mailing lists.  They will get lost!**  Use
the project hosting sites described below, and note that they are different
for Mailman 3 and 2.1.


GitLab Project Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mailman 3 (core, Postorius, HyperKitty, etc.) are all developed under the
`mailman <https://gitlab.com/groups/mailman>`__ group on `GitLab
<http://gitlab.com>`__.  All issues and pull requests should be submitted to the
appropriate sub-project.


Launchpad Project Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mailman 2.1 continues to be developed on the `Mailman project at Launchpad
<https://launchpad.net/mailman>`__. All patches, bugs, and merge proposals for
Mailman 2.1 should be submitted here.

IRC
~~~

Some of the Mailman developers also occasionally hang out on the ``#mailman``
IRC channel on the `freenode IRC network <https://freenode.net/>`__. Stop by!

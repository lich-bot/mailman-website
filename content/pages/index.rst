Mailman, the GNU Mailing List Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mailman is free software for managing electronic mail discussion and
e-newsletter lists. Mailman is integrated with the web, making it easy
for users to manage their accounts and for list owners to administer
their lists. Mailman supports built-in archiving, automatic bounce
processing, content filtering, digest delivery, spam filters, and more.
See the `features page <features.html>`__ for details.

Mailman is free software, distributed under the `GNU General Public
License <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html>`__, and written in
the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`__ programming language.

We want to thank our generous list of

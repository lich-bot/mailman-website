Mailman mailing lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have several mailing lists devoted to Mailman, which also provide a
nice demonstration of Mailman!

-  `Mailman
   Users <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-users>`__ is
   the mailing list to subscribe to if you are using Mailman at your
   site, and may have problems or questions relating to installation,
   use, etc. We'll try to keep the deep technical discussions off this
   list.
   (`*archives* <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/mailman-users/>`__)
-  `Mailman
   Announce <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-announce>`__
   is a read-only list that you can subscribe to if you are only
   interested in release notices and other important news. Only the core
   Mailman developers can post messages to this list.
   (`*archives* <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/mailman-announce/>`__)
-  `Mailman
   Developers <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-developers>`__
   is the mailing list to use if you are interested in helping us
   develop Mailman, discuss future directions, etc. This is the list for
   more in-depth technical issues.

   More information about developer resources is available
   `here <devs.html>`__.

-  `Mailman
   Internationalization <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-i18n>`__
   is the list for discussing the multi-lingual support in Mailman 2.1.
   Everyone who is working on translations of Mailman should subscribe
   to this mailing list.
   (`*archives* <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/mailman-i18n/>`__)
-  `Mailman
   Checkins <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-checkins>`__
   is an adjunct list to the publicly accessible, read-only, official
   `Mailman 2.1 Bazaar
   branch <https://code.launchpad.net/~mailman-coders/mailman/2.1>`__.
   This list is for the hardcore developers, or anybody else submitting
   patches, since we really prefer such patches to be generated against
   the latest snapshot. This is a read-only list; only the core Mailman
   developers can post messages to this list. There is no archive.

Mailman security issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GNU Mailman developers take security very seriously. All Mailman
security concerns should be emailed to `mailman-security at python dot
org <mailto:%6D%61%69%6C%6D%61%6E%2D%73%65%63%75%72%69%74%79%40%70%79%74%68%6F%6E%2E%6F%72%67>`__.
This is a closed list that reaches the core Mailman developers.

To ensure the highest security of your Mailman site, it is always best
to run the latest release. If you are not running the latest release,
please upgrade before reporting security issues.
